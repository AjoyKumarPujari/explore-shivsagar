<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joysagar, said to be the biggest man-made lake in the country, is spread over 318 acres (1.29 km2) of water on the edge of the town in an area called Rangpur, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) away from the present town of Sivasagar. This lake was built by Swargadeo Rudra Singha in honour of his mother, Joymoti.
The Tank Jayasagar was excavated by Tai-Ahom king Rudrasimha @ Siukhrungpha A.D. 1696-1714 to commemorate his mother’s name “JAYMATI” wife of Gadapani later King Gadadharsimha @ Siupatpha A.D. 1681-1695.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The place was chosen, where Siulikpha @ Lora Raja convicted “Jayamati” through his Chaodangs to extract information regarding her exiled husband Gadapani. Some scholars wrongly suggested that this tank was excavated by King Rudrasimha after a “Jay-Yatra” i.e., successful operation against enemy. The tank measures approximately 498 Bighas of land and biggest tank in Assam. The place was once known as Tengabari, Meteka etc. The important relics surrounding Jaysagar Tank are: Mankata Ali, Bar Ali, Bogidol and Pukhuri, Dubarani Ali, Jerenga Pathar, Barghat, Rangpur the fourth capital of the Tai-Ahom, Maheswarar Ghar, Ghanashyamar Dol, Keshavrai Dol, Hatikhok, Rudrasgar, Athaisagar, Lakhimisagar, Barpatra Dol, Pahugarh etc. This tank was under the occupation of Moamariyas, Burmese, and the British during the last days of the Tai-Ahom rulers (A.D.1228-1838). The famous educational institute of Upper Assam –"Sivasagar College” stands on its bank.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A man-made tank excavated by Ahom king Swargadeo Rudra Singha in memory of his mother Joymoti at Rangpur. Historical records reveal that the tank was constructed in 45 days at Rangpur in 1697. It is the largest man-made lake in India and stands on the area of 318 acres half of which is under water. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the northern side of the tank, there are temples namely Kesavarai Visnu Dol or Joydol, Baidyanath Shiva Dol, Devi-Ghar, Sri Suryya Mandir, Ganesh Mandir and Ghanashyam Dol or Nati-Gosai Dol. <br>
