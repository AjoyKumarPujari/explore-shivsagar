<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vishnu Dol is a temple of great architectural importance and is located just adjacent to the Shiva Dol. Constructed by Queen Madambika, wife of Shiva Singha, in 1734, the temple is dedicated to the worship of Lord Vishnu and can be visited all round the year. However, the month of Bhada (a month in the Hindu calendar) is very special for this temple. Daily kirtans and prayers are held in the temple all throughout the month and devotees from far and wide come to get a glimpse of the Lord. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vishnu Dol is a famous tourist destination in Assam along with Shiva Dol and Devi Dol. This temple is located on the bank of a 200 years old tank named Sivasagar. It was built during the reign of Ahom dynasty and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and his incarnations. It was constructed by Queen Madambika, wife of Ahom king Swargadeo Shiva Singha, in 1734. This site is visited by devotees from every part of the country during the month of Bhada. Kirtans and prayers are held in temple during this month and people from distant lands also come to visit during this time to get a glimpse of the revered Lord. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vishnu Dol is comparatively smaller in size than Shiva Dol lying adjacently, but with unique architectural value Vishnu Dol is mesmerizing. Reaching to a height of around 60 feet and 120 feet in diameter, the interiors of the temple has the Vaishnav influence. Since the belief of Vaishnavism is followed innately, no statue or sculpture of God resides within the temple. You will see Srimanta Sankardeva's sacred 'Namghosha' and other pious books of Vaishnavism are kept in the temple.
