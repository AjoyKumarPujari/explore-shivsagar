&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was in the middle ages that king Rudra Singha (1690 AD - 1714 AD), the 30th Ahom ruler got the fourth capital town constructed at Meteka and christened it as Che-mon. The construction of the new capital ‘Chemon’ or Rangpur was started in 1699 AD and after completion it was inaugurated in 1707 A.D. However, the existing capital at Garhgoan continued to function as the centre of administration whereas the new capital town at Rangpur was initially used as an army cantonment, centre of amusement, secretariat and court of law.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The new capital town of Rangpur was bounded on the east by Banhgarh (Bamboo rampant), the rivers Dikhow and Namdang on the west, whereas these two rivers again bounded the city on the north and the south respectively. Two main entrances to the capital town were the Singhaduar at Banhgarh on the east and the Namdang stone bridge on the west, and these two entrances were connected by the Bor Ali.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Raj Kareng or royal palace in the new capital complex stands magnificently near Joysagar tank. To its south stands the Fakua-Doul (Pa-Kua) with eight symbols and octagonal in shape, in keeping with Taoist cosmology, built by king Rudra Singha in 1703-04 A.D. for religious purposes, while the Ranghar known to be the first sports pavilion in Asia and built in its present shape by king Pramatta Singha in 1746 A.D. This Ranghar besides being used for enjoyment of indigenous traditional sports activities by the royal people and lords also served the king to hold conferences with foreign ambassador and dignitaries. Out of the five capital towns of the Ahom rule, as many as four - Charaideo, Saragua, Garhgaon and Rangpur, now lie within Sivasagar district, leaving out only Jorhat, the last capital, in the adjacent district by the same name.
The capital town of Rangpur was to the south of Dikhow River. The part on the northern bank was known earlier as Shivpur, later Sibsagar and now Sivasagar. Thus in the past Sivasagar and Rangpur were two different areas separated by Dikhow river, which in those days used to flow through the middle part of the present Sivasagar town – a stretch of the mori Dikhow or the dead river still exists by the side of the Sankardeva Samaj Namghar and Seuji Sangeet Vidyalya. Earlier the Sivasagar town was bounded by Cherekapar on the east, Kathpar on the west, Joyrapar in the north and Dhuliapar on the south. Nomenclature of river Dikhow owes its origin to the Bodo-Kachari group of Tibeto-Burman languages: Di meaning water or river and ‘khow’ high steep and thus Dikhow implies a river with high steep. This river in earlier times was also known as ‘klong’ or ‘klongso’ and the northern bank of Dikhow came to be known as Klongsopar or Kolongsopar, and, a little later still, as Doikolong. Till the fag end of the Ahom rule the name Shivpur persisted. Only after the treaty of Yandaboo in 1826 A.D. when the East India Company and for that matter, the British government came to hold power, Shivpur along with Rangpur came to be known as Sibsagar. As per historical records, Sir Newville in 1818 A.D. shifted the administrative headquarters from Rangpur to Jorhat where from thirty years later it was reverted to Rangpur by Mr. Scott and then moved to the bank of the Sibsagar tank by captain Broody in the same year. During British rule, the Sibsagar district comprised three sub-divisions: Sibsagar, Jorhat and Golaghat. In 1912 A.D. the district headquarter was again shifted to Jorhat leaving Sibsagar only as a sub-divisional headquarter. It remained so till 1983 when on 1 July of that year the Sibsagar and Golaghat sub-divisions of undivided Sibsagar district were declared as new districts by the Government of Assam. The newly constituted Sibsagar district has three sub-divisions, viz. Sibsagar, Nazira and Charaideo.
